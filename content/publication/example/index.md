abstract: The main aim is to develop a system that can efficiently and judiciously distribute available municipal water and produce a balance in consumption of the resource leading to increase in availability of water to areas with scarcity of water. If implemented in initiatives like smart cities, this system will provide an ideal solution to solve almost every problem regarding water management in modern metropolises and upgrade the system to a remotely controlled, efficient and user-friendly IoT platform leading to transparency and increased usage informatics.
