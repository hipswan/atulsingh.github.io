## Overview

There are many subtle changes that a user of an application does not even notice while navigating through the app, well at least consciously.
Furthermore, our subconscious mind is hardwired to nitpick structural differences accurately, that is the reason many popular applications add an element with an organic touch to it such as miro-interactions, textures, and touch-vibration to mimic the real-world interaction.
In this article, I would like to focus on Textures and Patterns,
Sometimes textures and patterns can be used interchangeably but in my opinion, textures are the designs that get repeated to form a pattern.
Having been using textures in web development applications I thought to implement the same in a flutter, and I found incorporating these textures with flutter SDK easy and without any hassle.
